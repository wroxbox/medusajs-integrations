---

## When to Use This Integration

### ✅ Perfect Fit Scenarios

#### 1. Existing Medusa v1 Installation

**Scenario:** You're already running Medusa v1 in production and need better content management.

**Why It Works:**
- No migration needed
- Plugin designed for v1 architecture
- Proven compatibility
- Active use in production stores

**Example:**
> "We launched our store 6 months ago on Medusa v1. Our content team is struggling with basic text fields. Strapi gives them the CMS they need without rebuilding everything."

#### 2. Strong FOSS Requirement

**Scenario:** Company policy requires fully open-source stack with no proprietary dependencies.

**Why It Works:**
- Both Medusa and Strapi are MIT licensed
- Full source code access
- No vendor agreements
- Self-hosted control
- Community-driven development

**Example:**
> "Our enterprise policy prohibits SaaS CMS tools. Strapi + Medusa is the only fully FOSS e-commerce + CMS solution we found."

#### 3. Content-Rich Product Catalog

**Scenario:** Products require extensive editorial content, multiple images, and structured data.

**Why It Works:**
- Rich text editor
- Media library management
- Custom content types
- Structured fields
- Relations between content

**Example:**
> "We sell artisanal furniture. Each product has a maker story, process photos, material specifications, and care instructions. Strapi's content modeling is perfect."

#### 4. Dedicated Content Team

**Scenario:** Non-technical content managers need independent workflow.

**Why It Works:**
- Visual admin interface
- No code required
- Draft/publish workflows (with plugins)
- User roles and permissions
- Intuitive editing experience

**Example:**
> "Our copywriters were editing JSON files via GitHub. With Strapi, they manage all content independently. Developer time freed up by 80%."

#### 5. Complex Content Relationships

**Scenario:** Products have complex relationships (related products, accessories, bundles, cross-sells).

**Why It Works:**
- Strapi's relation builder
- Many-to-many relationships
- Reference fields
- Nested content structures

**Example:**
> "Cameras have lenses, bags, batteries as accessories. Each accessory is also a product. Strapi's relations handle this complexity elegantly."

### ⚠️ Proceed with Caution

#### 1. New Medusa v2 Projects

**Why Caution:**
- Plugin built for v1, not v2
- Migration path unclear
- Newer integrations available (Sanity, Payload)
- Limited future support

**Workaround:**
- Stay on v1 (if acceptable)
- Or choose Sanity/Payload for v2

#### 2. Limited DevOps Resources

**Why Caution:**
- Two servers to maintain
- Two databases to backup
- Two systems to monitor
- Double the deployment complexity

**Workaround:**
- Use managed services (Strapi Cloud)
- Containerize with Docker
- Automate with IaC (Terraform)

#### 3. Simple Product Catalog

**Why Caution:**
- Overkill for basic products
- Adds unnecessary complexity
- Medusa's fields might be sufficient

**Workaround:**
- Start with Medusa only
- Add Strapi later if needed

### ❌ Not Recommended For

#### 1. Medusa v2 Deployments

**Reason:** Incompatible architecture.

**Alternative:** Use Sanity or Payload integrations built for v2.

#### 2. MVP / Quick Launch

**Reason:** Setup takes time, adds complexity.

**Alternative:** Use Medusa's built-in fields, add CMS later.

#### 3. Budget-Constrained Projects

**Reason:** Infrastructure costs double (2 servers, 2 databases).

**Alternative:** Use Medusa only, or choose embedded solution (Payload).

#### 4. Single-Person Team

**Reason:** Too much to maintain alone.

**Alternative:** Use managed CMS (Sanity) or simpler setup.

## Detailed Cons

### Con 1: Legacy Architecture ★★★★★ (Critical)

**Problem:**
- Built for Medusa v1 (released 2021)
- Medusa v2 has breaking changes (2024)
- No clear migration path
- Limited ongoing development

**Impact:**
```
New features in Medusa v2:
  ✗ Not compatible with this plugin
  
Bug fixes:
  ⚠️ Community-dependent
  
Security updates:
  ⚠️ May lag behind
```

**Risk:**
> "Invested 6 months building on v1 + Strapi. Medusa v2 announced. Now stuck on v1 or face expensive migration."

### Con 2: High Operational Complexity ★★★★☆

**Infrastructure Required:**
- Medusa server (Node.js)
- Medusa PostgreSQL
- Medusa Redis
- Strapi server (Node.js)
- Strapi PostgreSQL (separate)
- Load balancer (production)
- Monitoring (2 systems)
- Backups (2 databases)

**DevOps Burden:**

| Task | Without Strapi | With Strapi | Increase |
|------|----------------|-------------|----------|
| Servers | 1 | 2 | +100% |
| Databases | 1 | 2 | +100% |
| Monitoring | 1 system | 2 systems | +100% |
| Backups | 1 DB | 2 DBs | +100% |
| Updates | 1 codebase | 2 codebases | +100% |
| Logs | 1 source | 2 sources | +100% |

**Monthly Cost Estimate:**

```
Medusa:
  - EC2/Droplet: $40/month
  - PostgreSQL: $15/month
  - Redis: $10/month
  Subtotal: $65/month

Strapi:
  - EC2/Droplet: $40/month
  - PostgreSQL: $15/month
  Subtotal: $55/month

Total: $120/month (vs $65 without Strapi)
Extra: $55/month = $660/year
```

### Con 3: Synchronization Overhead ★★★☆☆

**Performance Impact:**
- Event bus latency (~100-250ms per sync)
- HTTP requests to Strapi
- Database writes in two systems
- Potential sync failures

**Example Timing:**
```
Create product in Medusa Admin:
  1. Save to Medusa DB: 50ms
  2. Emit event: 5ms
  3. Subscriber processes: 20ms
  4. Authenticate with Strapi: 100ms
  5. HTTP POST to Strapi: 150ms
  6. Strapi DB write: 80ms
  
Total: 405ms additional overhead
```

**Risk:** Sync failures if Strapi is down.

### Con 4: Dual Data Fetching ★★★☆☆

**Storefront Performance:**

**Option A: Two API Calls**
```javascript
// Medusa API call: 150ms
const product = await medusa.products.retrieve(id);

// Strapi API call: 200ms
const content = await strapi.getProduct(id);

// Total: 350ms (vs 150ms Medusa-only)
```

**Option B: Medusa Proxy**
```javascript
// Medusa → Strapi → Response: 250ms
const product = await medusa.getWithContent(id);

// Better, but still slower than direct
```

**Impact on SEO/UX:**
- Slower Time to First Byte (TTFB)
- Worse Core Web Vitals
- Higher bounce rate risk

### Con 5: Limited Reverse Sync ★★★★☆

**Problem:** Changes in Strapi don't flow back to Medusa.

**What This Means:**
```
✅ Medusa → Strapi: Full sync
❌ Strapi → Medusa: Only title/subtitle

Content team updates in Strapi:
  ✓ Rich descriptions: Stays in Strapi
  ✓ Images: Stays in Strapi
  ✓ Custom fields: Stays in Strapi
  ✗ Product title: Could sync, but manual
```

**Workaround:** Accept Strapi as content source, Medusa as commerce source.

### Con 6: Learning Curve ★★★☆☆

**What to Learn:**

**Medusa:**
- Commerce concepts
- Event bus
- Service architecture
- API structure

**Strapi:**
- Content types
- Relations
- API endpoints
- Admin interface

**Integration:**
- Sync mechanisms
- Authentication flow
- Troubleshooting
- Data mapping

**Time Investment:**
- Medusa basics: 1-2 weeks
- Strapi basics: 1 week
- Integration setup: 2-3 days
- Troubleshooting: Ongoing

### Con 7: Smaller Community ★★★☆☆

**Reality Check:**

| CMS Solution | GitHub Stars | Community Size |
|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Strapi | 60k+ | Large |
| Medusa | 23k+ | Growing |
| **This Plugin** | **<100** | **Small** |
| Sanity + Medusa | N/A | Medium |
| Payload + Medusa | N/A | Medium |

**Impact:**
- Fewer tutorials
- Harder to find help
- Limited Stack Overflow answers
- Slower bug fixes
- Maintenance depends on community

### Con 8: Sync Loop Potential ★★☆☆☆

**Risk:** Infinite update loops if not careful.

**Example:**
```
1. Update title in Medusa
2. Syncs to Strapi
3. Strapi triggers webhook
4. Updates Medusa
5. Syncs to Strapi
6. Repeat forever ♾️
```

**Mitigation:** Plugin uses Redis ignore flags, but requires Redis to be working.
