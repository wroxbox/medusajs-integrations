## Migration Paths

### Starting Without CMS → Adding Later

**Phase 1:** Launch with Medusa only
- Use markdown in description fields
- Store images directly in Medusa
- Get to market quickly

**Phase 2:** Assess needs (3-6 months)
- Is content management painful?
- Is team frustrated with limitations?
- Are we losing conversions due to content?

**Phase 3:** Add appropriate CMS
- Bulk sync existing products
- Train content team
- Gradually enrich content

### Between CMS Options

**Strapi → Payload (Medusa v2 migration)**
- Effort: Medium-High (2-3 weeks)
- Export Strapi content via API
- Migrate to Medusa v2
- Set up Payload integration
- Import content and test

**Sanity → Payload**
- Effort: High (3-4 weeks)
- Export from Sanity
- Transform data models
- Set up Payload
- Migrate and validate

**Contentful → Open Source (Payload/Strapi)**
- Effort: High (3-4 weeks)
- Export content via Contentful API
- Transform to new structure
- Rebuild infrastructure
- Extensive testing required
